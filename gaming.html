                    <p>I was hooked from the moment I began playing. Rocket League became free on the Playstation Store
                        for the first time in 2015. It immediately jumped to number one on my favorites, a spot previously
                        held by the Call of Duty series for 6 years.</p>

                    <p> Beginning with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2007), I played each new Call of Duty (COD) game consecutively
                        for 9 years. I spent countless hours mastering multiplayer gameplay, playing through story mode, and surviving
                        zombies, until I finally had enough in 2016. The series grew tired and repetitive.</p>
