                        <p>I've played competitive soccer for over 12 years, and it has shaped my life as much as anything
                            else that I have done.

                        <p>Street riding. Mountain riding. City riding. I do it all, and I'll never stop loving it.</p></div>

                    <div class="exercise"><h4>Hiking</h4><img src="img/people-hiking-1.jpg">
                        <p>Thanks to my parents taking my brothers and I on hiking trips when we were younger, I have
                            found hiking to be one of my favorite activities to do. Recently, I have taken it to the next level
                            by doing multi-day hikes (backpacking).

                    <div class="exercise"><h4>Calisthenics</h4><img src="img/calisthenics.jpg">
                        <p>Calisthenics is probably the fastest way to gain strength without going to a gym. Push-ups,
                            sit-ups, pull-ups, squats, etc. and all of the variations are more than enough to build muscle.
